Its pages gleamed,\r\nNot just with spells—but dreams redeemed.\r\n\nBack in the town, no more a fool,\r\nHis magic now both kind and cool.\r\n\nHe helped the lost, he mended tears,\r\nWith stardust joy and courage years.\r\n\nThe king proclaimed, “Our Royal Mage!”\r\nNot for perfection—but for brave heart’s stage.\r\n\nFor every trip, each slip, each fall,\r\nCan lead to greatness, after all!\r\n\nSo if you stumble, don’t you fear—\r\nYour misstep’s music, loud and clear!\r\n\nLike Elian, bold and full of cheer:\r\nYour greatest magic starts right here!",

    "lyrics": "In a tiny sun-drenched town, where \r\nthe sky was bright and clear,\r\n\nTwo peculiar kittens lived, they \r\nspent their afternoon right near.\r\n\nOne was Sun, with fur of gold, \r\neyes of blue, like the endless air,\r\n\nHe chased the sparkling motes \r\nof dust, without a single care.\r\n\nThe other, Shadow, gray and \r\ncalm, with eyes of olive green,\r\n\nHe dreamt of mysteries and \r\nrest, the quieter of the scene.\r\n\nUpon an old rooftop they stayed, \r\neach with a different view of light,\r\n\nBut both were waiting for a secret, \r\nto make the day exciting and right.\r\n\nThen a playful gust of wind \r\narrived, a sudden flurry in the air,\r\n\nIt dropped an old and worn-out \r\nmap, landing exactly there.\r\n\nIt showed a hidden treasure spot, \r\nin the village, lost and deep,\r\n\nSun jumped up with pure excitement, \r\nShadow woke from his deep sleep.\r\n\n“Come on, Shadow, adventure calls, \r\nthe treasure we must find today!”\r\n\n“Patience, Sun, the riddle is first, \r\nlet’s see the path and find the way.”\r\n\nThey left the roof and all their \r\ngames, ready to begin the stride,\r\n\nFollowing the ancient lines, \r\nletting the map be their guide.\r\n\nThe first stop on the treasure hunt \r\nwas the old Windmill, cool and grand.\r\n\nSurrounded by a gentle breeze, \r\na magical spot in the land.\r\n\nInside there was a riddle carved, \r\na puzzle for their curious heads.\r\n\n“Soft as a feather, but can make you \r\nsleep. What is it?” the riddle said.\r\n\nSun thought of clouds and fluffy things, \r\nhis mind could not make sense of it,\r\n\nBut Shadow, calm and quick and sure, \r\nsaid: “My pillow, where I sit!”\r\n\nCorrect! The singing birds exclaimed, \r\nthe pathway opened wide with speed,\r\n\nAnd on they went upon their quest, \r\nplanted like an ancient seed.\r\n\nThey rushed to Mrs. Flower’s garden, \r\na rainbow on the fertile ground.\r\n\nWith happy, buzzing bees at \r\nwork, making a cheerful sound.\r\n\nThe colorful life was smiling back, \r\nanother clue came quick and fast.\r\n\nThe final hint then pointed to the \r\n\"Great Tree of Knowledge,\" built to last.\r\n\nThey reached the mighty central \r\ntree, in the plaza, vast and old.\r\n\nThe birds were singing history, \r\nancient tales of strength and gold.\r\n\nSun and Shadow looked at each \r\nother, the mission nearly through.\r\n\nThey realized the journey’s purpose, \r\nwas not just finding something new.\r\n\nThey searched and searched the bark and \r\nroots, for any hidden sign or trace.\r\n\nSun digging with his little paws, \r\nShadow watching the entire space.\r\n\nThe map then vanished in the air, the \r\nquest was finally done and sealed.\r\n\nThe treasure was not gold or gems, \r\nbut a secret they had just revealed.\r\n\nIt was the friendship growing strong, \r\njust like that old and mighty tree,\r\n\nAnd all the help they’d given \r\nout, to every person, happily.\r\n\nSun and Shadow, heroes of the town, \r\nno longer seeking mere wealth.\r\n\nThey found the greatest treasure: \r\ntheir friendship and good health.",

The light faded fast,\r\n\nThe magic of love, a shadow of the past.\r\nThe Martian spirit turned selfish and cold,\r\n\nA story of darkness that had to unfold.\r\nBut Zilbo the tiny, he knew what to do,\r\n\nTo bring back the bright \r\nglow, to make love feel new.\r\n\nHe took his nut shells, his energy fuel,\r\n\nAnd started his journey, defying the cruel\r\nChallenges waiting, the rivers and the snow,\r\n\nHis hope and his pure heart continued to glow.\r\nThe secret he found was no curse or dark spell,\r\n\nJust the lack of true \r\ngratitude where Martians dwell.\r\n\nA selfless pure action was the key to restart,\r\nTo fill every person with love in their heart.\r\n\nHe returned to his home, \r\nwith a clear, honest sight,\r\n\nTo perform the great act \r\nthat would summon the light.\r\n\nHis cherished nut shells, his most precious prize,\r\nHe shared them with everyone,\r\n\nbefore all their eyes.\r\nA simple devotion, a spark caught the air,\r\n\nThe love that was sleeping began to repair.\r\nThe cosmic synth bass is ready to pump!\r\n\nAnd suddenly, shining, the radiance came back,\r\n\nThe ground glowed with magic, \r\nright there on the track.\r\n\nBut the twist was the sweetest, \r\nthe truth he then knew:\r\n\nThe shells held light seeds, \r\nthat he spread as he flew.\r\n\nBy eating and sharing, the magic was freed,\r\nThe love was recovered by a tiny green deed.\r\n\nZilbo, the small hero, with love as his might,\r\nSaved the whole planet by spreading his light.\r\n\nNow when you walk here, you \r\nfeel love deep and sound,\r\n\nBecause of Zilbo and the shells he unbound.\r\n\nA Martian so tiny, a spirit so grand,\r\nHe made the ground sparkle across the whole land.",

It was all in vain!\r\n\nThat lingering, awful fragrance \r\nwas driving them insane!\r\n\nMom and Dad were stressed \r\nout, the air was hard to face,\r\n\nZara knew it was her fault, \r\nshe'd wreck the family space.\r\n\nShe remembered Grandmother, \r\nwith her wisdom clear and plain:\r\n\nA bad smell is defeated by a clever, fresh domain.\r\nShe declared: \"I'll be the chemist!\r\n\nI will find the proper key!\"\r\nA self-appointed mission, full of energy.\r\n\nThe kitchen is the laboratory, \r\nthe stove is my big tool!\r\n\nHerbs and spices, oh so many, following no rule.\r\n\nShe tried some pepper, \r\ncloves, and vinegar so sour,\r\n\nBut the crimson bottle’s scent \r\nheld on with all its power!\r\n\nAfter many crazy mixes, \r\nthe solution came in sight,\r\n\nA golden combination, shining oh so bright!\r\nLavender, fresh lemon zest, and garden-grown mint,\r\n\nA natural neutralizing \r\nblend, without a single hint\r\n\nOf that old and awful perfume; \r\nthe bad air disappeared,\r\n\nThe home was fresh and happy, \r\nand the family cheered!\r\n\nSmash! The crimson bottle fell, \r\nthe glass went everywhere,\r\n\nBut the determined young \r\ngirl conquered the foul air.\r\n\nWith lavender, lemon, mint, \r\nshe showed them how to be,\r\n\nA broken bottle only means \r\na chance to grow and see.\r\n\nAnd the Gomez house breathed \r\nfresh air, harmony was deep,\r\n\nThe crimson secret is the lesson that you keep!",

DROP THE BASS, BRING THE RAIN!\nFIRE AND WATER, BREAK THE CHAIN!\n\nFLAMERINA!

I am tiny, the world expands wide,\r\nA desert of fabric, nowhere left to hide.\r\n\nNow I'm crossing the border, the unseen line,\r\nReady to battle, the forgotten mine!\r\n\nForgotten Kingdom! Dust bunny mountains rise!\r\nWhere lonely socks dream and the old watch dies.\r\n\nShadow Guardians creep, they watch every move,\r\nBut courage is massive, we got something to prove.\r\n\nCouch-side adventure, the crumbs are our gold,\r\nThis epic's unspoken, a story untold!\r\n\nWe break the silence, we fight the dark air,\r\nFreedom is waiting, just beyond despair!\r\n\nMet Centi the fire, a forgotten bright spark,\r\n\nBurning the fear out, lighting up the dark.\r\nValleys of cookie-dust, rivers of grey,\r\n\nWe weave through the darkness, finding a way.\r\nThe whispers are chilling, the shadows are fast,\r\n\nTraps in the fibers, built to always last.\r\nBut we push harder, driven by the friend,\r\n\nThe journey won't stop until the very end.\r\nTo the Palace of the Forgotten,\r\n\nwalls built from old toys,\r\nHearing the echoes of long-lost joys.\r\n\nForgotten Kingdom!

It’s heavy \r\nmetal, spinning fast and free!\r\n\nDon’t chase the phantom future \r\nor the ghosts of history!\r\n\n(Tick-Tock) Every second is a \r\ndiamond, you cannot rewind the track\r\n\n(Boom-Clack) You held the power in \r\nyour hands, but could you ever go back?\r\n\nOh, the Key of Time! It beats the \r\nrhythm, fast and sharp and true!\r\n\nThe only moment that is real \r\nis standing right with you!\r\n\nShe played the game too \r\nboldly, another fateful spin\r\n\nNow lost in eras ancient, where \r\nthe wild world rushed right in\r\n\nNo gentle village faces, \r\njust survival's urgent strain\r\n\nShe sought the key's true essence \r\nthrough the sunshine and the rain.\r\n\nIt’s not the lock you open, \r\nit’s the love inside your core\r\n\nA key that turns on feelings, \r\nthat unlocks so much more.\r\n\nShe focused on the memory \r\nof family, warmth, and grace\r\n\nA longing for the present, \r\na return to her own space.\r\n\nThe Key of Time!

It beats the \r\nrhythm, fast and sharp and true!\r\n\nThe only moment that is real \r\nis standing right with you!\r\n\nThe light was warm this final \r\ntime, a beacon shining bright\r\n\nShe traded endless wandering \r\nfor the simple, daily light\r\n\nThe history is written, \r\nthe future holds its breath\r\n\nThe deepest power Lía found was \r\nconquering the fear of depth.\r\n\nDon't grasp the dial of the \r\nclock, don't try to speed the pace\r\n\nThe greatest story ever told \r\nis lived in this one place!\r\n\nThe Key of Time!

It beats the \r\nrhythm, fast and sharp and true!\r\n\nThe only moment that is real \r\nis standing right with you!\r\n\nShe locked the key away, \r\nthe lesson burned in stone\r\n\nEvery single moment is the gift that’s truly known\r\nLive it now, live it loud, live it day by day.\r\n\nThe Key of Time is knowing \r\nhow to make the moment stay.\r\n\nMoment stay.",

The sun grew\r\n\npale, the flowers lost their hue, 'Cause when \r\nyou take the joy, there's nothing left for you.\r\n\nGATHER THE LIGHT, but don't you dare to keep \r\nit! Let the colors fly, let the world feel the\r\n\nspirit. SHINE a little brighter, give it all away, \r\nA shared spark burns forever, come what may! It's\r\n\nnot in the holding, it's in the letting go, That's \r\nhow the brightest magic starts to truly grow!\r\n\nLittle Lily watched, her eyes wide with surprise, \r\nSaw the grumpy faces beneath the barren skies. She\r\n\nfound a single spark, on a dew-kissed leaf, And \r\ndidn't try to hide it, ignoring all their grief.\r\n\nShe blew a tiny kiss, and let the light expand, \r\nA wildfire of wonder, spreading through the land.\r\n\nGATHER THE LIGHT, but don't you dare to keep \r\nit! Let the colors fly, let the world feel the\r\n\nspirit. SHINE a little brighter, give it all away, \r\nA shared spark burns forever, come what may! It's\r\n\nnot in the holding, it's in the letting go, That's \r\nhow the brightest magic starts to truly grow!\r\n\nThe bags burst open wide, a blinding, \r\ngolden flood, The grumpy Collectors felt\r\n\na change in their blood. They learned the \r\nbiggest truth, with a sudden, joyful tear:\r\n\nThe light you give away is the one that \r\nstays right here. Sharing is the sun,\r\n\nand hoarding is the night, Now let your \r\ntiny flicker turn into a mighty light!\r\n\nGATHER THE LIGHT, but don't you dare to keep \r\nit! Let the colors fly, let the world feel the\r\n\nspirit. SHINE a little brighter, give it all away, \r\nA shared spark burns forever, come what may! It's\r\n\nnot in the holding, it's in the letting go, That's \r\nhow the brightest magic starts to truly grow!\r\n\nShine! Shine! The world is getting \r\nbright! Shine! Shine! Share your\r\n\nbeautiful light! Yeah! Give \r\nit away! Let it shine today!",

They're flying high!\r\nShining, soaring, up to the sky!\r\n\nThey pop with color, they burst with cheer,\r\nBanish the gray, banish the fear!\r\n\nWe are magnificent, we are bold,\r\nA story in glitter, a tale to be told!\r\n\nIf you love who you are, let the whole world see,\r\nBlow a Bubble of Pride, set your spirit free!\r\n\nGrayscale arrived, a shadow on the scene,\r\n\nTried to steal the rainbow, tried to be mean.\r\nSucking up the joy, dimming every heart,\r\n\nTrying to tear our whole bright world apart.\r\nBut Llamarada won't stand for that gloom,\r\n\nWe gotta banish the darkness, \r\nmake the colors bloom!\r\n\nCalled up the fairies, the gnomes, and the crew,\r\nGotta make this bubble brilliant and new!\r\n\nOh, the Bubbles of Pride! They're flying high!\r\nShining, soaring, up to the sky!\r\n\nThey pop with color, they burst with cheer,\r\nBanish the gray, banish the fear!\r\n\nWe are magnificent, we are bold,\r\nA story in glitter, a tale to be told!\r\n\nIf you love who you are, let the whole world see,\r\nBlow a Bubble of Pride, set your spirit free!\r\n\nTook a deep breath, from my belly to my soul,\r\nFocused the magic, let the pride take control!\r\n\nThe light was intense, the power untold,\r\nA brilliant mirror, silver and gold!\r\n\nGrayscale retreated, fading into mist,\r\nJoy is the power you can't resist!\r\n\nWe stood together, a shining, loud parade,\r\nThe brightest, proudest choice we ever made!\r\n\nWe won, we won! The gray is gone!\r\nShout it out until the break of dawn!\r\n\nPride is the key, love is the way,\r\nBlow a bubble, celebrate today!\r\n\nBoom! Pop! Sparkle! Shine!\r\nThe Bubbles of Pride are eternally mine!",

He walked!\r\n\nOliver the Scarecrow, wired, wild, and strange\r\n\nPulled his wooden feet right \r\nout of the rye field's range\r\n\nNo more the post of silent dread, \r\nno more the feathered fright\r\n\nI've got the spark of destiny, \r\ncharged by meteor light!\r\n\nTop hat cocked and tipping \r\nlow, a tremor in the lace\r\n\nI'm rattling down the forest \r\npath, to find my rightful place!\r\n\nThe moon is fat, the air is \r\ncold, the journey has begun\r\n\nI trade the boredom of the \r\npatch for the power of the Sun!\r\n\nOh, the Primordial Burst, a crack in the dark!\r\n\nThe life they said I couldn't \r\nhave, ignited by a spark!\r\n\nI'm a patchwork king, a moving \r\nthing, with courage in my chest\r\n\nI tear the stitches of my fate, \r\nand put my soul to the test!\r\n\nFrom hay and hemp and lonely \r\nnights, I burst into the day\r\n\nThe whispering wind can't hold \r\nme down, I'm finding out my way!\r\n\nIf you can dream the wicked dream, \r\nthe burst will make you real!\r\n\nThis frantic, frantic rhythm \r\nis the life I get to feel!\r\n\nThe ancient Oak of Elowen, \r\nhe warned of twisted trails\r\n\nOf Siren screams by churning \r\nstreams, where every promise fails\r\n\nHe gave me patience, wisdom’s \r\nplea, a compass pointing safe\r\n\nThrough foggy mazes, fairy \r\nlies, and shadows on the waif\r\n\nI sprinted past the singing \r\ntraps, I laughed at all the tricks\r\n\nA walking, talking tapestry \r\nof twigs and worn-out fix!\r\n\nThey tried to stop my onward \r\nmarch, to push me back to dust\r\n\nBut the meteor fire in my soul is \r\ndriven by a lust! (For living!)\r\n\nThe Crystal Mountain, sharp and \r\nhigh, where fickle tempests play\r\n\nTo capture the most elusive gust,\r\n\nand finally win the day!\r\n(Chase, chase, chase!)\r\n\nMy silly top hat, what a tool! \r\nI scooped the wind up quick!\r\n\nThe spirit bowed, the challenge \r\nmet, I did the spooky trick!\r\n\nNo longer just a static prop, \r\nI faced the roaring fear\r\n\nThe biggest blast of life you \r\nknow, is the reason I am here!\r\n\nOh, the Primordial Burst, a crack in the dark!\r\n\nThe life they said I couldn't \r\nhave, ignited by a spark!\r\n\nI'm a patchwork king, a moving \r\nthing, with courage in my chest\r\n\nI tear the stitches of my fate, \r\nand put my soul to the test!\r\n\nFrom hay and hemp and lonely \r\nnights, I burst into the day\r\n\nThe whispering wind can't hold \r\nme down, I'm finding out my way!\r\n\nIf you can dream the wicked dream, \r\nthe burst will make you real!\r\n\nThis frantic, frantic rhythm \r\nis the life I get to feel!\r\n\nHear the whisper, hear the drum!\r\nThe scarecrow's story has begun!\r\n\nOliver the legend!

A giant disc \r\nin the sky, unblinking big and wide.\r\n\nUnderneath that watchful eye, \r\nthere's nowhere left to hide.\r\n\nTino the cat. He walks onto a nervous jumpy tabby. \r\nKept his routine simple and true. Avoiding things\r\n\ntoo scary. But a strange sound on the breeze. \r\nA whisper pulling near. Awakening deep unease\r\n\nconfirming Tino's fear. He sees a shape \r\nfluid and dark slipping through the trees,\r\n\nleaving its elusive mark riding on the crazy \r\nbreeze. Red moon look painting everything\r\n\nbright. My heart is pounding. He should \r\nbe in his bed. The shadow is swift. Oh,\r\n\na monster of the night. It's a terrible \r\ngift stepping into the light. Red\r\n\nfrom the haze. Red. Lost inside the maze.\r\n\nTo the old mill where the stories said the \r\ngears still turn alone. Past the fence where\r\n\nthe sleepy dead have made their quiet home. \r\nHe pushes the door. A painful long protesting\r\n\ncreek. The air is thick, the silence strong. \r\nTino cannot speak. The figure disappears,\r\n\nabsorb into the wall, challenging \r\nall his years. Tino stands up tall,\r\n\nred moon, painting everything bright. My heart \r\nis pounding. He should be in his bed. Oh,\r\n\nthe shadow is swift, but a monster of the \r\nnight. It's a terrible gick stepping into\r\n\nthe light. Red, red, running from the \r\nhay. Red, red, lost inside the hay.\r\n\nThen the filter of light through the dusty \r\nancient glass revealed the truth that night,\r\n\nmaking the tension pass. A \r\nwavy mirror standing high,\r\n\nreflecting back the fright. The scariest \r\nshadow that went by was Tino in the light.\r\n\nH. What a goofy, silly smile. The mystery was\r\n\ndone. Fear was just silly \r\nfor a while. A victory t1\r\n\nred moon rising painting everything bright. My \r\nfear is gone now. He should be in his bed. That\r\n\nshadow was swift. A monster of the night. \r\nBut it was just me stepping into the light.\r\n\nRed funny, not afraid. Red, best.\r\n\nThe crimson glow fades slow. Tino \r\nwalks back home. The greatest fears\r\n\nwe know are just what we have dreamed. \r\nA trick of light and shade under the\r\n\nbig red moon. The fearful shadows \r\nare made and banish just as soon.",

I let it go.\nTo save her fire, I learned to grow.\n\nShine, radiant heart—the vow is kept.\nThe star is whole… and never slept.\n\nOh, Alheri… you glow at last.\nMy pulse, your light—forever cast.\n\nNo more twilight.\nOnly dawn.\n\nShine with me…\nForever on.",

UNRAVEL! Be brave, don’t stop!\nOnly the truth can heal and lift us up.\n\nFACE THE KNOT! Let the rhythm rise,\nUntie your fear—and peace will fill the skies!\n\nA cloud-pouch packed with tools galore,\nA truth-telling mirror, starlight at its core.\n\nWhispering woods and misty bridges span,\nEach trial a challenge—light defeats the dark.\n\nHe crossed each threshold, \nclimbed and then came down,\n\nSeeking the secret that held the whole town.\n\nThe journey was hard, but his faith held strong—\nHe shielded all dreams from fear’s cruel throng!\n\nOH, THE TANGLE OF SECRETS—CHAOS EVERYWHERE!\nFear in the shadows, silence cold and bare.\n\nPULL! UNRAVEL! Be brave, don’t stop!\nOnly the truth can heal and lift us up.\n\nFACE THE KNOT! Let the rhythm rise,\nUntie your fear—and peace will fill the skies!\n\nTjo! Tjo! In the fjell of dreams, \nthe shadow’s dense and deep,\n\nThe essence whispers: “Will \nmy soul forget to dream?”\n\nThe fear of being lost—that’s the root of pain,\nBut Ziggy speaks with love, again, again:\n\n“I swear, I swear—your dreams will never fade,\nNo thread will break while we hold them safe!”\n\nThe great knot softens, threads begin to flow,\nWith courage and promise… all souls bloom anew!\n\nOH, THE TANGLE OF SECRETS—CHAOS EVERYWHERE!\nFear in the shadows, silence cold and bare.\n\nPULL! UNRAVEL! Be brave, don’t stop!\nOnly the truth can heal and lift us up.\n\nFACE THE KNOT! Let the rhythm rise,\nUntie your fear—and peace will fill the skies!\n\nTangle tamed! No more fear today!\nZiggy weaves dreams in the gentlest way.\n\nIf fear wraps ‘round you, hear his call:\n“Untie your soul… and fly—unbound,\n\nfree, and tall.”\n(whisper) …freedom.",
