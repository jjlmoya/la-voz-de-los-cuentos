Back on the floor, all for all!\r\n\nMr. Garcia smiles: \"The lesson it gave today,\r\nIs that important things are unseen,\r\n\nand they must always stay.\"\r\nValeria and Leo learned:\r\n\n\"Don't take things for granted, dear.\"\r\nSince that day, every jump is celebrated,\r\n\nyear after year!\r\nThank you, Gravity!",
